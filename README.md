# **ProjectWakeyWakey**

Coding and Building an Alarm Clock from an Arduino which wakes the User with Light

To-Do-List:
- [x] Reworking the way the Arduino turns on the Lamp, using a stopwatch
     - [x] make the light turn on using a stop watch
     - [x] change the Interrupts to Falling
- [x] Rework the Way the Time gets processed
- [x] Change the way the AlarmScreen and the SlumberScreen are alternating between each other
- ~~Join the alarmScreen and SlumberScreen class to one class~~
- [x] code refactoring + better commentaries

What i learned from this Project:
- More Prototyping, in hindsight a lot of frustration with how things work and if it will work could have been avoided
- Better Planning in the Planning Phase. I focused a lot on one Solution which might have worked okay, blending other solutions which would have worked better out.
  This dragged the Project unnecessarily long out and made it increalingly frustrating
- Higher Usage of libraries and or predefined Software-Parts lile Variables. At the beginning i tried to do everything myself, which only went meh.
  The use of Libraries and or other Software-Parts makes the Project shorter and better
